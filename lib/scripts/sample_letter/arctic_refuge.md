Rep. Nancy Pelosi,

My name is Bob the Builder and I am a consituent of your district. 

Against the wishes of the majority of Americans, the controversial tax law passed by the Senate in 2017 opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration and drilling. It was an unconscionable abuse of the federal budget process, but now you have the chance to make things right.

The Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act (H.R. 1146) would restore protections to the calving and nursing grounds of the Porcupine Caribou Herd, the home of denning polar bears, musk oxen and wolves, and the nesting habitat of nearly 200 species of migratory birds. 

To the indigenous Gwich’in people—whose survival depends on a healthy Porcupine Caribou Herd—protecting the coastal plain of the refuge is a matter of human rights. We have a moral obligation to protect this wild, beautiful place for the Gwich’in, and all other Americans.

As America increasingly focuses on addressing the crisis of climate change, we must begin to turn away from fossil fuels. The Arctic Refuge – which is already warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet – is the first place we need to protect if we are going to achieve our goal of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.

Please take this opportunity to protect the Arctic Refuge for our children and grandchildren. Please  co-sponsor H.R. 1146.

Your Constituent
