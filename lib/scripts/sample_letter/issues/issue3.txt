I’m writing to ask that you support the Chaco Cultural Heritage Protection Act (S.2907). Drilling at the doorstep of Chaco Canyon would destroy the cultural experience visitors find here and pollute the air in and around this historic site. What’s more, the lands surrounding the park contain countless unprotected Ancestral Puebloan ruins and artifacts, which could be lost forever to oil and gas development as leasing is continuing unabated. This new legislation recognizes the extensive and interconnected cultural resources across the landscape that are worthy of protection.
