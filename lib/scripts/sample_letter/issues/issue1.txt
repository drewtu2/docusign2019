Thank you for taking a stand to defend the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge from oil and gas development. The controversial tax law passed by the Senate in 2017 defied the wishes of the majority of Americans by opening the refuge to exploration and drilling. Your co-sponsorship of H.R. 1146 is a big step toward making things right.

By supporting the Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act (H.R. 1146), you are helping lead the way toward restoring protections to the calving and nursing grounds of the Porcupine Caribou Herd, the home of denning polar bears, musk oxen and wolves, and the nesting habitat of nearly 200 species of migratory birds.

Your support is vital to the indigenous Gwich’in people, whose survival depends on a healthy Porcupine Caribou Herd. For the Gwich’in, protecting the coastal plain of the refuge is a matter of human rights. We have a moral obligation to protect this wild, beautiful place for the them, and all other Americans.

As America increasingly focuses on addressing the crisis of climate change, we must begin to turn away from fossil fuels. The Arctic Refuge – which is already warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet – is the first place we need to protect if we are going to achieve our goal of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.

Thank you for defending the Arctic Refuge.
