I am writing to ask that the BLM Bakersfield Field Office fully evaluate and address potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing in the Central Valley, including considering the need to refrain from moving forward with new leasing entirely and to put in place meaningful protections.

BLMâ€™s initial analysis of impacts from hydraulic fracturing in the Bakersfield Field Office was not sufficient. It underestimated impacts on air quality, drinking water, protected public lands and local communities and did not consider making any meaningful changes to current management.

Specifically, BLM should consider an alternative for no new leasing and an alternative that includes:

- Setbacks from schools and other high-occupancy community facilities, developed with public and local input and based on the study of the health effects of oil and gas development;

- Setbacks from irrigation facilities and other water sources;

- An air quality monitoring regime and measures to mitigate particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds and other pollutants;

- Comprehensive disclosure and evaluation of impacts from toxic materials used in hydraulic fracturing;

- Identifying parks, recreation areas, wildlife habitat and other areas that must be shielded from development impacts;

- Full and proactive range of opportunities for public participation, including public comment opportunities for all lease sales, public meetings, providing bilingual information when necessary and performing NEPA analysis for all lease sales.

Please amend the Bakersfield RMP to include alternatives that fully and legitimately consider the tremendous risks involved in hydraulic fracturing and the consequences that could befall communities in the Central Valley.
